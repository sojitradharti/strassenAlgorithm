# Strassen Algorithm

## Empirical Analysis of Matrix Multiplication Algorithms: 

The purpose of the homework assignment is to learn how to do empirical analysis of algorithms based on scientific principles. The traditional matrix multiplication algorithm performs very well for small matrices and does poorly on problems of large sizes. On the other-hand, Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm performs efficiently on problem sizes that are large. You are to combine the two algorithms in general and study if there is a way to design a new algorithm that leverages the strength of both while reducing their negative side. In your empirical examination, you must determine the optimum break-even point. We need to see good data gathering, evidence of fact, method used, how you dealt with the fluctuations in measurements, graphs, predictions, etc. Also, studying other algorithms with even more efficiencies than Strassen’s. For extra points, implement all of the above in the C programming language, compare the performance of the C implementation to that of Java.
